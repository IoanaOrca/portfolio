## Steps to prepare

- Wash the **beans** and put them to boil. The water just needs to cover slightly the beans and no more. Boil until the skin starts to become wrinkled.
- At that point change the water with some fresh one in which you add a bit of **salt** and bring it to boil again.
- If the beans are very old you can leave them to soak in water starting the night before. Like that you can shorten the time you need to boil them.
- If it happens for the water to go down during the boiling then add some more hot water. You can have some water boiled in the kettle for example.
- After about an hour the beans should start to get soft. Try them and if you like the consistence then add the chopped **onions**, the **parsnip** cut in slices and the grated celery root.
- It’s good for the beans to be boiled on a low heat, a long time with the lead on. After we put the onions and the roots, bring all to boil and let it boil for about 30-40 minutes on a low heat.
- If the beans are well boiled after this time then add the chopped red pepper and the sweet paprika.
- After about 15 minutes add the sliced carrot and boil for another 5-10 minutes.
- If you wish and everything is boiled you can add a spoon of tomato paste – but that is optional.
- The red pepper, paprika and the carrot give the soup a red colour anyway. The tomato paste intensifies it.
- Close to the end of the boil add the dry thyme and as much salt as you like. Add 2-3 tbsp of vegetable oil and leave it boil for 2-3 more minutes, after the soup should be done.
- To serve it you can add some chopped parsley on top as it just gives it a special nice taste.

_Optionally_ you can top it up with smantana.
